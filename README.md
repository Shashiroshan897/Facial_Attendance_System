# Facial_Attendance_System

Face recognition attendance systems can thus be proved to be secure and efficient. In real time scenarios, the Haar Cascade Classifiers outperforms other algorithms and 
found to be suitable for implementation of this work. 
It gives a better recognition rate with a low false rate. 
 
Using Raspberry Pi independently improves the mobility of 
the work and it acts as a standalone hardware.
The work can be further developed by improving 
recognition rate and by using Raspberry Pi Infra Red camera module this system can be used as a security surveillance system.
